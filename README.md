### Best projects

<!-- match3 -->

<details>
<summary>
<h4>Untitled Match 3 game</h4> <h6>A match-3 roguelike inspired by Puzzle Quest and Peglin.</h6>
</summary>

This is not going to be an open source project. This is something I think could be commercially viable, and it's something I'd like to release someday, and having it be open source would be detrimental to my experience working on it. Maybe someday in the future I'll decide differently.

This game, so far, is my magnum opus. It's a unique concept that has some similar competitors, but none that achieve what I imagine for the game. I think it'll be a really enjoyable experience and it'll scratch the itch of roguelike in an easily digestible way, while also having the complexity and depth of some of the best roguelikes out there. Endless replayability and build synergy are two core things that I want this to embody and provide.

<h4>mooshroom</h4> <h6>A command-line tool to download JAR files from Mojang.</h6>
</summary>

This is a tool I developed to help me personally with downloading any version of Minecraft as a JAR file in an automatic way. I needed a simple way to get JAR files that I could use via either a command line (over SSH, in this case), or via a secondary tool, like a UI I wrote for my personal usage to manage my own Minecraft server for my friends.

<!-- powah -->

<summary>
<h4>powah</h4> <h6>(Dropped) A game about generating electricity through the technological ages, written in C# with Monogame.</h6>
</summary>

I love automation, real-time strategy, and resource management games. Factorio and Age Of Empires 2 with my dad are some of my fondest memories, and they've always been my favorite games, even now, ten years later. Resource management is something that is incredibly fun for me, and I really enjoy designing systems to maximise efficiency and optimise production methods.

I started writing powah because I wanted the experience of making a game, from scratch, without using gigantic tools and engines such as Unity or Unreal Engine. I chose [Monogame](https://monogame.net/) (XNA) because it has the exact amount of control I want to have, the exact amount of do-it-myself I wanted to do, but provided a solid foundation to start on and a good system of organisation for my code.

This project is dropped because I found some very similar games, and lost some passion for the project (I wanted it to be something entirely unique). My design document is the most complete and full representation of my vision for this game.

<h4>11</h4> <h6>Emulation of Windows 11 in the browser using Web Components.</h6>
</summary>

I've actually done this project twice. Once as "11", and once as "winUI". I decided to restart from the first one because I wanted to change the basic structure of how I was implementing features.

Initially, I had intended to have a simple-ish re-creation of the Windows Out-Of-Box-Experience, in the browser. Feature creep got me, and I soon had a list of things I wanted to implement that would make the emulation have nearly entire feature-parity with the actual operating system, including a fully-featured filesystem, launchable and "installable" apps, and a full emulation of the desktop experience, including "system-wide" volume and screen controls.

Obviously, this was a huge task, and I have since stopped developing that project, as it was out of scope and had derailed into an inordinate amount of work. I was not particularly happy with how I'd led myself into a hole with it. If I were to do it again, I'd like to create a design document ahead of time, list out the feature set I would like to implement, and possibly create some different workflows for creating assets and completing features.

This was a fun project, and I gained a lot of insight throughout the process of developing to the point I got to. It was very instructive in how scope moves fluidly, and often goes wildly out of capability. This project turned into a hugely informative and enjoyable experience, even though I never reached a conclusion. I'd love to start this again someday and take it from the top.
