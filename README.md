### Current Projects

<h4>powah</h4> <h6>A game about generating electricity through the technological ages, written in C# with Monogame.</h6>
</summary>

I love automation and real-time strategy games. Factorio and Age Of Empires 2 with my dad are some of my fondest memories, and they've always been my favorite games, even now, eight to ten years later. Resource management is something that is incredibly fun for me, and I really enjoy designing systems to maximise efficiency and optimise production methods.

I'm writing powah because I wanted the experience of making a game, from scratch, without using gigantic tools and engines such as Unity or Unreal Engine. I chose [Monogame](https://monogame.net/) because it has the exact amount of control I want to have, the exact amount of do-it-myself I wanted to do, but provided a solid foundation to start on and a good system of organisation for my code.

This game is my favorite project, because I understand some of the ways it's awesome. It's not just a simple webapp, not just some HTML thrown together. I get to play with real efficiency, real optimisation, and see the effects of my work in actual apps running on my system. I don't entirely know why, but writing an application that actually runs on my computer is so much cooler.

<h4>w11</h4> <h6>Emulation of Windows 11 in the browser using Web Components.</h6>
</summary>

Initially, I had intended to have a simple-ish re-creation of the Windows Out-Of-Box-Experience, in the browser. Feature creep got me, and I soon had a list of things I wanted to implement that would make the emulation have nearly entire feature-parity with the actual operating system, including a fully-featured filesystem, launchable and "installable" apps, and a full emulation of the desktop experience, including "system-wide" volume and screen controls.

Obviously, this was a huge task, and I have since stopped developing that project, as it was out of scope and had derailed into an inordinate amount of work. I was not particularly happy with how I'd led myself into a hole with it. If I were to do it again, I'd like to create a design document ahead of time, list out the feature set I would like to implement, and possibly create some different workflows for creating assets and completing features.

This was a fun project, and I gained a lot of insight throughout the process of developing to the point I got to. It was very instructive in how scope moves fluidly, and often goes wildly out of capability. This project turned into a hugely informative and enjoyable experience, even though I never reached a conclusion. I'd love to start this again someday and take it from the top.
